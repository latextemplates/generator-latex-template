# Use xxx for example presentation

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to present LaTeX examples.
They should be shown as LaTeX source and rendered output.

## Decision Drives

* Write once - have two outputs (source and rendered)
* Good interaction with all pacakges

## Considered Options

* [tcolorbox](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tcolorbox) - nice boxes, but does not support floating environments
* [showexpl](https://ctan.org/pkg/showexpl) - does not fully support floating environments
* [latexdemo](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexdemo) - nice boxes, but does not support floating environments
* `tkzexample` (part of [tkz-doc](https://ctan.org/pkg/tkz-doc)) - nice boxes, but does not support floating environments
* `fancyvrb-ex` (part of [facnyvrb](https://ctan.org/pkg/fancyvrb)) - nice boxes, but does not support floating environments
* `cnltx-example`(part of [cnltx](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/cnltx)) - nice boxes, but does not support isolated floating environments
* [sverb](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/sverb) - offers the `demo` environment. Does not support isolated floating environments.
* `lstdoc` (part of [listings](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/listings)) - works inside the listings package, but causes issues at "normal" usage.
* `ydoc-expl` (part of [ydoc](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/ydoc))
* [gincltex](https://ctan.org/pkg/gincltex)
* [minted](https://ctan.org/pkg/minted)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "examplep", because comes out best (see below).

* examplep: allows for minipages automatically set to correctly render the LaTeX source. Bad, because it is GPL-licensed and thus requires all tex files to be GPL-licensed, too.
* `tkzexample`, `tcolorbox`, `latexdemo`, `fancyvrb-ex`, `cnltx-example`: Do not support floats.
* `gincltex`: Includes .tex as graphics; rendering as source and rendered has to be done "on top".
* `minted` has the `example` environment in its source (taken from <http://blog.karssen.org/2009/11/15/a-latex-example-environment/>): https://github.com/gpoore/minted/blob/5d72859d714a6f2f6a42eec524476994d954b960/source/minted.dtx#L134.
  Does not deal with protection.

Hint: Bold typewriter keywords can be generated by the LuxiMono package (hint by listings package).
