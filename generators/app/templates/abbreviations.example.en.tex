<%= heading2 %>{Abbreviations}

With \verb+\gls{...}+ you can enter abbreviations, the first time you call it, the long form is used.
When reusing \verb+\gls{..}+ the short form is automatically displayed.
The abbreviation is also automatically inserted in the abbreviation list.
With \verb+\glspl{...}+ the plural form is used.
If you want the short form to appear directly at the first use, you can use \verb+\glsunset{..}+ to mark an abbreviation as already used.
The opposite is achieved with \verb+\glsreset{..}+.

Abbreviations are defined in \verb+\content\ausarbeitung.tex+ by means of \verb+\newacronym{...}{...}{...}+.
