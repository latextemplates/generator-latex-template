<%= heading2 %>{Citations}

When referencing something from the bibliography file, it will automatically appear in the references section.
If a reference is not cited, it is not appearing there.

<%- bexample %>
Standard case: Citing indirectly citing something~\cite{mwe}.
In case one wants to name the author: \textcite{mwe} shows a minimal \LaTeX{} example.
<%- eexample %>

Note that \texttt{\textbackslash textcite\{mwe\}} prints both the author and the reference to the bibliography entry.

Remember that you have to call \texttt{biber <%= filenames.main %>} to generate the bibliography data for \texttt{<%= reallatexcompiler %>}.
You will need to run \texttt{<%= reallatexcompiler %>} twice to ensure that the page numbers are updated correctly.
